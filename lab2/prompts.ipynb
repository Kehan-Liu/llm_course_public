       "The process begins with the death of a massive star, typically one with a mass at least 3-4 times that of the sun. As the star runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into an incredibly small space. This compression creates an intense gravitational field, which in turn warps the spacetime around the star, creating a boundary called the event horizon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the event horizon is formed, anything that crosses it, including light, is trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape. The point of no return, called the singularity, is located at the center of the black hole, where the curvature of spacetime is infinite and the laws of physics as we know them break down.\n",

       "There are four types of black holes, each with different properties and formation mechanisms: stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, and miniature black holes. Stellar black holes are the smallest and most common type, formed from the collapse of individual stars. Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are found at the centers of galaxies and can have masses billions of times that of the sun.\n",

       "The study of black holes is an active area of research, with scientists using a variety of observational and theoretical tools to understand these enigmatic objects.

       "When investigating a cheating case, it's essential to understand the tactics and behaviors associated with cheating. Here are some common characteristics and verbal cues that may indicate deceitful behavior:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Inconsistencies in their story**: Cheaters often have difficulty keeping their lies straight, so listen for inconsistencies in their alibi, timeline, or details.\n",
       "2. **Deflecting or evading questions**: Cheaters might avoid direct answers, change the subject, or become overly defensive when confronted with questions.\n",
       "3. **Micro-expressions**: Pay attention to fleeting facial expressions that can reveal their true emotions, such as guilt, anxiety, or nervousness.\n",
       "4. **Body language**: Cheaters may exhibit closed-off or aggressive body language, like crossing their arms, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting.\n",
       "5. **Overly elaborate or rehearsed responses**: Liars might provide too much information or use overly complex explanations to convince you of their innocence.\n",
       "6. **Minimizing or downplaying**: Cheaters may try to downplay the severity of their actions or shift the blame to someone else.\n",
       "7. **Incongruence between words and actions**: Be wary of individuals whose words and actions don't align, such as saying they're committed to their relationship while displaying flirtatious behavior with someone else.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some common phrases or verbal cues that may indicate cheating include:\n",
