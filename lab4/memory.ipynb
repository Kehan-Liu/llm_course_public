Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy any- where.\n",

The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",

As Mr. Durs- ley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",

      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis- pering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people\n",

Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important tele- phone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",

      "He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy.

You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much.

      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al- though he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy any- where.\n",

Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",

He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.\n",

As Mr. Durs- ley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis- pering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people\n",

Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important tele- phone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",

      "He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy.

On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!

He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for some- thing. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”\n",

Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.

You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\n",

Hagrid led them into the forest to investigate an injured unicorn.\\n\\n2. **Discovery of the Dead Unicorn**: The group found a slain unicorn in a clearing, its blood silver and still shining. This was highly unusual, as unicorns are magical creatures whose blood can sustain life but comes with a terrible curse.\\n\\n3. **Encounter with Voldemort**: Harry and Malfoy split from the group (with Fang). Harry encountered a cloaked figure (later revealed to be Voldemort possessing Quirrell) drinking the unicorn's blood to sustain himself. This caused Harry's scar to burn painfully.\\n\\n4. **Rescue by Firenze**: The centaur Firenze intervened, carrying Harry to safety and explaining that the act of drinking unicorn blood would give the drinker a cursed, half-life. Firenze also hinted at Harry's importance in the coming conflict with Voldemort.\\n\\n5. **Centaurs' Warning**: The centaurs (including Ronan and Bane) debated whether to interfere in human affairs, with Firenze choosing to help Harry despite their usual policy of non-interference.\\n\\nThese events revealed Voldemort's presence at Hogwarts and his desperate attempts to regain strength, setting up the climax of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.\"}"

      "Abstract—The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the “Squeeze-and-Excitation” (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for\n",

      "ONVOLUTIONAL neural networks (CNNs) have proven C to be useful models for tackling a wide range of visual tasks [1 , (4. At each convolutional layer in the net- work, a collection of filters expresses neighbourhood spatial connectivity patterns along input channels—fusing spatial and channel-wise information together within local recep- tive fields. By interleaving a series of convolutional layers with non-linear activation functions and downsampling op- erators, CNNs are able to produce image representations that capture hierarchical patterns and attain global theo- retical receptive fields. A central theme of computer vision research is the search for more powerful representations that capture only those properties of an image that are most salient for a given task, enabling improved performance. As a widely-used family of models for vision tasks, the development of new neural network architecture designs now represents a key frontier in this search. Recent research has shown that\n",

      "In this paper, we investigate a different aspect of network design - the relationship between channels. We introduce a new architectural unit, which we term the Squeeze-and- Excitation (SE) block, with the goal of improving the quality of representations produced by a network by explicitly mod- elling the interdependencies between the channels of its con- volutional features. To this end, we propose a mechanism that allows the network to perform feature recalibration, through which it can learn to use global information to selectively emphasise informative features and suppress less useful ones.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "The structure of the SE building block is depicted in Fig. For any given transformation F;,, mapping the input X to the feature maps U where U € R#XWxC, e.g. a convolution, we can construct a corresponding SE block to perform feature recalibration. The features U are first passed through a squeeze operation, which produces a channel descriptor by aggregating feature maps across their spatial dimensions (H x W). The function of this descriptor is to produce an embedding of the global distribution of channel-wise feature responses, allowing information from the global receptive field of the network to be used by all its layers. The aggregation is followed by an excitation operation, which takes the form of a simple self-gating mechanism that takes the embedding as input and pro- duces a collection of per-channel modulation weights. These weights are applied to the feature maps U to generate the output of the SE block which can be fed directly into subsequent layers of the network.\n",

In earlier layers, it excites infor- mative features in a class-agnostic manner, strengthening the shared low-level representations. In later layers, the SE blocks become increasingly specialised, and respond to dif- ferent inputs in a highly class-specific manner (Section |7.2}. As a consequence, the benefits of the feature recalibration performed by SE blocks can be accumulated through the network.\n",

      "The design and development of new CNN architectures is a difficult engineering task, typically requiring the se- lection of many new hyperparameters and layer configura- tions. By contrast, the structure of the SE block is simple and can be used directly in existing state-of-the-art architectures by replacing components with their SE counterparts, where the performance can be effectively enhanced. SE blocks are also computationally lightweight and impose only a slight increase in model complexity and computational burden.\n",

      "Deeper architectures. VGGNets and Inception mod- els [5] showed that increasing the depth of a network could significantly increase the quality of representations that it was capable of learning. By regulating the distribution of the inputs to each layer, Batch Normalization (BN) (61 added stability to the learning process in deep networks and produced smoother optimisation surfaces [12]. Building on these works, ResNets demonstrated that it was pos- sible to learn considerably deeper and stronger networks through the use of identity-based skip connections (131, (74). Highway networks introduced a gating mechanism to regulate the flow of information along shortcut connections. Following these works, there have been further reformula- tions of the connections between network layers\n",

While often computationally demand- ing, evolutionary search has had notable successes which include finding good memory cells for sequence models (271, and learning sophisticated architectures for large- scale image classification .

However, we found that this compara- tively costly final stage of SE blocks could be removed at only a small cost in performance (<0.1% top-5 error on ImageNet) reducing the relative parameter increase to ~4%, which may prove useful in cases where parameter usage is a key consideration (see Section for further discussion).\n",

Although it is beyond the scope of this work, we anticipate that further efficiency gains will be achievable by tailoring SE block usage for specific architectures.\n",

Specifically, we remove the pooling op- eration and replace the two FC layers with corresponding 1 x 1 convolutions with identical channel dimensions in the excitation operator, namely NoSqueeze, where the ex- citation output maintains the spatial dimensions as input. In contrast to the SE block, these point-wise convolutions can only remap the channels as a function of the output of a local operator.

SE_5_2 exhibits an interesting tendency towards a saturated state in which most of the activations are close to one. At the point at which all activations take the value one, an SE block reduces to the identity operator. At the end of the network in the SE_5_3 (which is immediately followed by global pooling prior before classifiers), a similar pattern emerges over different classes, up to a modest change in scale (which could be tuned by the classifiers). This suggests that SE_5_2 and SE_5_3 are less important than previous blocks in providing recalibration to the network. This finding is consistent with the result of the empirical investigation in Section [4] which demonstrated that the additional parameter count could be significantly reduced by removing the SE blocks for the last stage with only a marginal loss of performance.\n",

A wide range of experiments show the effectiveness of SENets, which achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and tasks. In addition, SE blocks shed some light on the inability of previous architectures to adequately model channel-wise feature de- pendencies. We hope this insight may prove useful for other tasks requiring strong discriminative features. Finally, the feature importance values produced by SE blocks may be of use for other tasks such as network pruning for model compression.\n",

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.\n",

The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demon- strate that this improves performance and provide an in- tuition that led to this design.\n",

We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.\n",

      "Our main contribution is a novel layer module: the inverted residual with linear bottleneck. This mod- ule takes as an input a low-dimensional compressed representation which is first expanded to high dimen- sion and filtered with a lightweight depthwise convo- lution. Features are subsequently projected back to a low-dimensional representation with a linear convolu- tion. The official implementation is available as part of TensorFlow-Slim model library in [4].\n",

      "This module can be efficiently implemented using standard operations in any modern framework and al- lows our models to beat state of the art along multiple performance points using standard benchmarks. Fur- thermore, this convolutional module is particularly suit- able for mobile designs, because it allows to signifi- cantly reduce the memory footprint needed during in- ference by never fully materializing large intermediate tensors. This reduces the need for main memory access in many embedded hardware designs, that provide small amounts of very fast software controlled cache memory.\n",

In this paper, we pursue the goal of developing better intuition about how neural net- works operate and use that to guide the simplest possible network design. Our approach should be seen as compli- mentary to the one described in [23] and related work. In this vein our approach is similar to those taken by [20, 22] and allows to further improve the performance, while providing a glimpse on its internal operation. Our network design is based on MobileNetV1 [27]. It re- tains its simplicity and does not require any special op- erators while significantly improves its accuracy, achiev- ing state of the art on multiple image classification and detection tasks for mobile applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Depthwise Separable Convolutions are a key build- ing block for many efficient neural network architectures [27, 28, 20] and we use them in the present work as well. The basic idea is to replace a full convolutional opera- tor with a factorized version that splits convolution into two separate layers. The first layer is called a depthwise convolution, it performs lightweight filtering by apply- ing a single convolutional filter per input channel. The second layer is a 1 x 1 convolution, called a pointwise convolution, which is responsible for building new fea- tures through computing linear combinations of the in- put channels.\n",

      "Consider a deep neural network consisting of n layers , each of which has an activation tensor of dimensions h, x w; xX d;. Throughout this section we will be dis- cussing the basic properties of these activation tensors, which we will treat as containers of h; x w; “pixels” with d; dimensions. Informally, for an input set of real images, we say that the set of layer activations (for any layer L;) forms a “manifold of interest”. It has been long assumed that manifolds of interest in neural networks could be embedded in low-dimensional subspaces. In other words, when we look at all individual d-channel pixels of a deep convolutional layer, the information encoded in those values actually lie in some manifold, which in turn is embeddable into a low-dimensional sub- space’.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "At a first glance, such a fact could then be captured and exploited by simply reducing the dimensionality of a layer thus reducing the dimensionality of the oper- ating space. This has been successfully exploited by MobileNetV 1 [27] to effectively trade off between com- putation and accuracy via a width multiplier parameter, and has been incorporated into efficient model designs of other networks as well [20]. Following that intuition, the width multiplier approach allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the activation space until the mani- fold of interest spans this entire space. However, this intuition breaks down when we recall that deep convo- lutional neural networks actually have non-linear per co- ordinate transformations, such as ReLU. For example, ReLU applied to a line in 1D space produces a ’ray’, where as in R” space, it generally results in a piece-wise linear curve with n-joints.\n",

      "It is easy to see that in general if a result of a layer transformation ReLU(Bz) has a non-zero volume S, the points mapped to interior S are obtained via a lin- ear transformation B of the input, thus indicating that the part of the input space corresponding to the full di- mensional output, is limited to a linear transformation.

Experimental evidence suggests that using linear layers is crucial as it prevents non- linearities from destroying too much information. In Section 6, we show empirically that using non-linear layers in bottlenecks indeed hurts the performance by several percent, further validating our hypothesis*. We note that similar reports where non-linearity was helped were reported in [29] where non-linearity was removed from the input of the traditional residual block and that lead to improved performance on CIFAR dataset.\n",

The former can be seen as the capacity of the network at each layer, whereas the latter as the expressiveness. This is in contrast with tra- ditional convolutional blocks, both regular and separa- ble, where both expressiveness and capacity are tangled together and are functions of the output layer depth.\n",

      "We described a very simple network architecture that allowed us to build a family of highly efficient mobile models. Our basic building unit, has several proper- ties that make it particularly suitable for mobile appli- cations. It allows very memory-efficient inference and relies utilize standard operations present in all neural frameworks.\n",

      "For object detection task, our network outperforms state-of-art realtime detectors on COCO dataset both in terms of accuracy and model complexity. Notably, our architecture combined with the SSDLite detection mod- ule is 20x less computation and 10x less parameters than YOLOv2.\n",

We argue that ifm < n, transformations of this form can only exploit non-linearity at the cost of losing infor- mation. In contrast, ifn < m, such transforms can be highly non-linear but still invertible with high probabil- ity (for the initial random weights).\n",

      "Proof: Let S’ = interior ReLU(S). First we note that if x € S’, then x; > 0 for all i. Indeed, image of ReLU does not contain points with negative coordinates, and points with zero-valued coordinates can not be interior points. Therefore for each x € S’, = ReLU(z) as desired.\n",

      "It follows that for an arbitrary composition of inter- leaved linear transformation and ReLU operators, if it preserves non-zero volume, that part of the input space X that is preserved over such a composition is a lin- ear transformation, and thus is likely to be a minor con- tributor to the power of deep networks. However, this\n",
      "=========\n",
      "is a fairly weak statement. Indeed, if the input mani- fold can be embedded into (nm — 1)-dimensional mani- fold (out of n dimensions total), the lemma is trivially true, since the starting volume is 0. In what follows we show that when the dimensionality of input manifold is significantly lower we can ensure that there will be no information loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the ReLU(«) nonlinearity is a surjective func- tion mapping the entire ray < 0 to 0, using this nonlin- earity in a neural network can result in information loss. Once ReLU collapses a subset of the input manifold to a smaller-dimensional output, the following network lay- ers can no longer distinguish between collapsed input samples. In the following, we show that bottlenecks with sufficiently large expansion layers are resistant to infor- mation loss caused by the presence of ReLU activation functions.\n",

Let yo = ReLU(Bzo) for some x € R\", then equation yy) = ReLU(Bz) has a unique solution with respect to x if and only if yo has at least n non-zero val- ues and there are n linearly independent rows of B that correspond to non-zero coordinates of yo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proof: Denote the set of non-zero coordinates of yo as T and let yr and Br be restrictions of y and B to the subspace defined by T. If |T| < n, we have yr = Brxo where Br is under-determined with at least one solution xo, thus there are infinitely many so- lutions. Now consider the case of |T'| > n and let the rank of Br be n. Suppose there is an additional solu- tion x; # ao such that yy = ReLU(Bz2}), then we have yr = Brxo = Bray, which cannot be satisfied unless t= 27,.8\n",

We further show that with respect to initialization, we can be sure that these constraints are satisfied with high proba- bility. Note that for random initialization the conditions of lemma 2 are satisfied due to initialization symmetries. However even for trained graphs these constraints can be empirically validated by running the network over valid inputs and verifying that all or most inputs are above the threshold.

      "The problem this paper is concerned with is that of unsupervised learning. Mainly, what does it mean to learn a probability distribution? The classical answer to this is to learn a probability density. This is often done by defining a parametric family of densities (P9)gcge and finding the one that maximized the likelihood on our data: if we have real data examples {a }m, we would solve the problem\n",

      "If the real data distribution P, admits a density and Pg is the distribution of the parametrized density Pg, then, asymptotically, this amounts to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence K L(P,-||P9).\n",
      "=========\n",
      "For this to make sense, we need the model density Pg to exist. This is not the case in the rather common situation where we are dealing with distributions supported by low dimensional manifolds. It is then unlikely that the model manifold and the true distribution’s support have a non-negligible intersection (see [I]), and this means that the KL distance is not defined (or simply infinite).\n",
      "=========\n",
      "The typical remedy is to add a noise term to the model distribution. This is why virtually all generative models described in the classical machine learning literature include a noise component. In the simplest case, one assumes a Gaussian noise with relatively high bandwidth in order to cover all the examples. It is well known, for instance, that in the case of image generation models, this noise degrades the quality of the samples and makes them blurry. For example, we can see in the recent paper [23] that the optimal standard deviation of the noise added to the model when maximizing likelihood is around 0.1 to each pixel in a generated image, when the pixels were already normalized to be in the range [0,1]. This is a very high amount of noise, so much that when papers report the samples of their models, they don’t add the noise term on which they report likelihood numbers. In other words, the added noise term is clearly incorrect for the problem, but is needed to make the maximum\n",

      "=========\n",
      "Rather than estimating the density of P, which may not exist, we can define a random variable Z with a fixed distribution p(z) and pass it through a paramet- ric function gg : Z + 4X (typically a neural network of some kind) that directly generates samples following a certain distribution Pg. By varying 0, we can change this distribution and make it close to the real data distribution P,.. This is useful in two ways. First of all, unlike densities, this approach can represent distribu- tions confined to a low dimensional manifold. Second, the ability to easily generate samples is often more useful than knowing the numerical value of the density (for example in image superresolution or semantic segmentation when considering the conditional distribution of the output image given the input image). In general, it is computationally difficult to generate samples given an arbitrary high dimensional density [16].\n",
      "=========\n",
      "Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [4] are well known examples of this approach. Because VAEs focus on the approximate likelihood of the examples, they share the limitation of the stan- dard models and need to fiddle with additional noise terms. GANs offer much more flexibility in the definition of the objective function, including Jensen-Shannon [4], and all f-divergences as well as some exotic combinations [6]. On the other hand, training GANs is well known for being delicate and unstable, for reasons theoretically investigated in [I].\n",

      "In this paper, we direct our attention on the various ways to measure how close the model distribution and the real distribution are, or equivalently, on the various ways to define a distance or divergence p(P»,P,). The most fundamental difference between such distances is their impact on the convergence of sequences of probability distributions. A sequence of distributions (P;),en converges if and only if there is a distribution P,, such that p(P;,P..) tends to zero, something that depends on how exactly the distance p is defined. Informally, a distance p induces a weaker topology when it makes it easier for a sequence of distribution to converg' Section [| clarifies how popular probability distances differ in that respect.\n",

      "In order to optimize the parameter 6, it is of course desirable to define our model distribution P, in a manner that makes the mapping @ +> Py, continuous. Continuity means that when a sequence of parameters 0; converges to @, the distributions Po, also converge to Pg. However, it is essential to remember that the notion of the convergence of the distributions Py, depends on the way we compute the distance between distributions. The weaker this distance, the easier it is to define a continuous mapping from @-space to P9-space, since it’s easier for the distributions to converge. The main reason we care about the mapping @ +> P¢ to be continuous is as follows. If p is our notion of distance between two distributions, we would like to have a loss function @ ++ p(P9,P,) that is continuous, and this is equivalent to having the mapping 9 +> Pg be continuous when using the distance between distributions p.\n",

The mode dropping phenomenon that is typical in GANs is also drastically reduced. One of the most compelling practical benefits of WGANs is the ability to continuously estimate the EM distance by training the discriminator to op- timality. Plotting these learning curves is not only useful for debugging and hyperparameter searches, but also correlate remarkably well with the observed sample quality.\n",

      "The fact that the EM distance is continuous and differentiable a.e. means that we can (and should) train the critic till optimality. The argument is simple, the more we train the critic, the more reliable gradient of the Wasserstein we get, which is actually useful by the fact that Wasserstein is differentiable almost everywhere. For the JS, as the discriminator gets better the gradients get more reliable but the true gradient is 0 since the JS is locally saturated and we get vanishing gradients, as can be seen in 1] of this paper and Theorem 2.4 of [I]. In|F we show a proof of concept of this, where we train a GAN discriminator and a WGAN critic till optimality. The discriminator learns very quickly to distinguish between fake and real, and as expected provides no reliable gradient information. The critic, however, can’t saturate, and converges to a linear function that gives remarkably clean gradients everywhere. The fact that we constrain the weights limits the possible growth of\n",

We identified momentum as a potential cause because, as the loss blew up and samples got worse, the cosine between the Adam step and the gradient usually turned negative. The only places where this cosine was negative was in these situations of instability. We therefore switched to RMSProp which is known to perform well even on very nonstationary problems [13].\n",

As mentioned, this has the advantage of not requiring a separate network to approximately maximize equation (4). However, GMMNs have enjoyed limited applicability. Partial explanations for their unsuccess are the quadratic cost as a function of the number of samples and vanishing gra- dients for low-bandwidth kernels. Furthermore, it may be possible that some kernels used in practice are unsuitable for capturing very complex distances in high dimensional sample spaces such as natural images. This is properly justified by the fact that shows that for the typical Gaussian MMD test to be reliable (as in it’s power as a statistical test approaching 1), we need the number of samples to grow linearly with the number of dimensions.

We introduce two simple global hyper- parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effective- ness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classifica- tion, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.\n",

      "Convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in computer vision ever since AlexNet [19] popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the Ima- geNet Challenge: ILSVRC 2012 [24]. The general trend has been to make deeper and more complicated networks in order to achieve higher accuracy [27, 31, 29, 8]. How- ever, these advances to improve accuracy are not necessar- ily making networks more efficient with respect to size and speed. In many real world applications such as robotics, self-driving car and augmented reality, the recognition tasks need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computation- ally limited platform.\n",

Many different approaches can be generally categorized into either compressing pretrained networks or training small networks directly. This paper proposes a class of network architectures that allows a model devel- oper to specifically choose a small network that matches the resource restrictions (latency, size) for their application. MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for latency but also yield small networks. Many papers on small networks focus only on size but do not consider speed.\n",

Flattened networks [16] build a network out of fully factorized convolutions and showed the poten- tial of extremely factorized networks. Independent of this current paper, Factorized Networks[34] introduces a similar factorized convolution as well as the use of topological con- nections. Subsequently, the Xception network [3] demon- strated how to scale up depthwise separable filters to out perform Inception V3 networks. Another small network is Squeezenet [12] which uses a bottleneck approach to design a very small network. Other reduced computation networks include structured transform networks [28] and deep fried convnets [37].\n",

Additionally var- ious factorizations have been proposed to speed up pre- trained networks [14, 20]. Another method for training small networks is distillation [9] which uses a larger net- work to teach a smaller network.

For MobileNets the depthwise convolution ap- plies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1 x 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size.

Often convolutions are implemented by a GEMM but require an initial reordering in memory called im2col in order to map it to a GEMM. For instance, this approach is used in the popular Caffe package [15]. 1 x 1 convolutions do not require this reordering in memory and can be implemented directly with GEMM which is one of the most optimized numerical linear algebra algorithms.

However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmen- tation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31]. Addi- tionally, we found that it was important to put very little or no weight decay (12 regularization) on the depthwise filters since their are so few parameters in them. For the ImageNet benchmarks in the next section all models were trained with same training parameters regardless of the size of the model.\n",

      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but suffer from training instability. The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable train- ing of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms. ‘\n",

      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [9] are a powerful class of generative models that cast generative modeling as a game between two networks: a generator network produces synthetic data given some noise source and a discriminator network discriminates between the generator’s output and true data. GANs can produce very visually appealing samples, but are often hard to train, and much of the recent work on the subject [23, 19, 2, 21] has been devoted to finding ways of stabilizing training. Despite this, consistently stable training of GANs remains an open problem.\n",

Their proposed alternative, named Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [2], leverages the Wasserstein distance to produce a value function which has better theoretical properties than the original. WGAN requires that the discriminator (called the critic in that work) must lie within the space of 1-Lipschitz functions, which the authors enforce through weight clipping.\n",

      "No critic batch normalization Most prior GAN implementations [22, 23, 2] use batch normaliza- tion in both the generator and the discriminator to help stabilize training, but batch normalization changes the form of the discriminator’s problem from mapping a single input to a single output to mapping from an entire batch of inputs to a batch of outputs [23]. Our penalized training objective is no longer valid in this setting, since we penalize the norm of the critic’s gradient with respect to each input independently, and not the entire batch. To resolve this, we simply omit batch nor- malization in the critic in our models, finding that they perform well without it. Our method works with normalization schemes which don’t introduce correlations between examples. In particular, we recommend layer normalization [3] as a drop-in replacement for batch normalization.\n",

In our early observations we found this to perform slightly better, but we don’t investigate this fully. We describe experiments on the one-sided penalty in the appendix.\n",

However, it is easily seen that the conditions of Theorem | and Corollary 1 of [2] are satisfied even on this non-standard learning scenario with X = A7. This means that W(P,,P,) is still well defined, continuous everywhere and differentiable almost everywhere, and we can optimize it just like in any other continuous variable setting.

Now that we have a more stable algorithm for training GANs, we hope our work opens the path for stronger modeling performance on large-scale image datasets and language. Another interesting direction is adapting our penalty term to the standard GAN objective function, where it might stabilize training by encouraging the discriminator to learn smoother decision boundaries.\n",

Alongside UIB, we present Mobile MQA, an at- tention block for mobile accelerators, delivering a significant 39% speedup. An optimized neural architecture search (NAS) recipe is also introduced which improves MNv4 search effectiveness. The integration of UIB, Mo- bile MQA and the refined NAS recipe results in a new suite of MNv4 models that are mostly Pareto optimal across mobile CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, as well as accelerators like Apple Neural Engine and Google Pixel Ed- geTPU.

      "Importance of Operational Intensity: Vision model research has largely focused on improving efficiency by reducing MACs. Since accelerators greatly increase computational capabilities without proportionally increasing memory bandwidth, many models are bottlenecked by memory access and solely mini- mizing MACs will not improve performance. Instead we must consider the Op- erational Intensity—the ratio of arithmetic operations to memory access. MQA is efficient in hybrid models: MHSA projects the queries, keys, and values into multiple spaces to capture different aspects of the information. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) simplifies this by sharing keys and values across all heads. While large language models require multiple query heads, they can share a single head for keys and values without sacrificing accuracy (3) 27]. When the number of batched tokens is small compared to the feature dimen- sions, sharing one head across keys and values reduces memory bandwidth\n",

Our experiments confirm MQA’s advantage in hybrid models. As shown in Tab 2|MQA achieves >39% accelera- tion on EdgeTPUs and Samsung $23 GPU with negligible quality loss (-0.03%) compared to MHSA.

On EdgeTPUs, MNv4 mod- els are as accurate as MobileNetV3 and 2x as fast. MNv4-Conv-M is >50% faster than MobileOne-S4 and Fast ViT-S12 and has +1.5% more Top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 at comparable latency. On $23 GPU and iPhone 13 CoreML (ANE), MNv4 is mostly at the Pareto front. MIT-Efficient ViT—which has the closest performance on $23 GPU—has >2x the latency as MNv4 on CoreML at the same accuracy. Fast ViT—optimized for Apple Neural Engine—is 2nd on CoreML but has >5x the latency of MNv4 on $23 GPU. While some models, such as Efficient ViT, reach the same accuracy with fewer MACs, MobileNet V4 models are optimized for high accuracy and minimal latency on the most hardware pos- sible.

For each backbone, we build a detector using the RetinaNet framework. We attach a 256-d FPN decoder to the P3 - P7 endpoints, as well as a 256-d prediction head with 4 con- volutional layers. As usual for mobile detectors, we use depth-separable convolu- tions for an efficient FPN decoder and box prediction head. We train all models on COCO 17 for 600-epochs. Images are resized to 384px and augmented with random horizontal flip, random scale, and Randaug {20}. We exclude Shear and Rotate from Randaug, as those deteriorate small-object detection AP. The models are trained with a 2048 batch size, Adam {25}, and a 0.00003 L2 weight decay, plus a cosine LR schedule with 24 epochs warm-up. The learning rate is tuned per-model.

This suggests that mixing expands the augmented image space, increases difficulty and diversity, and leads to improved student performance. JFT Data Augmentation: To increase training data volume, we add in- domain, class-balanced data by resampling the JFT-300M dataset to 130K images per class (130M total). Following Noisy Student and using Efficient Net- BO trained on ImageNet-1K, we select images with a relevance threshold above 0.3. For classes with abundant data, we choose the top 130K images; for rare classes, we replicate images for balance. This dataset is replicated 10x. Due to JFT’s complexity, we apply weaker augmentations (Inception Crop + Ran- dAugment 12m5). This is dataset D3. Tab. [8] shows that using solely Ds drops accuracy by 2%.

      "In this paper, we presented MobileNetV4, a series of universal, efficient mod- els that run efficiently across the mobile ecosystem. Multiple advances make MobileNet V4 mostly-Pareto-optimal on all mobile CPUs, GPUs, DSPs and spe- cialized accelerators, a characteristic not found in any other models tested. We introduced the Universal Inverted Bottleneck and Mobile MQA layers and com- bined them with improved NAS recipes. With these and a novel, SOTA distilla- tion approach, we achieve 87% ImageNet-1K accuracy at 3.8ms Pixel 8 EdgeTPU latency, setting a new state-of-the-art. Finally, we introduced a framework for understanding model universality on heterogeneous devices. We hope the novel contributions and analysis further spur advances in mobile computer vision.\n",

To enhance efficiency, models were converted to TensorFlow Lite format and quantized to INT8 for mobile CPUs, Hexagon, and EdgeTPUs, while FP16 was used for mobile GPUs. We run each model roughly 1000 times and take the mean latency of those runs. We then repeat that process 5 times for each model and report the median of means. To optimize performance, we set the CPU affinity to the fastest core and use the XNNPACK backend for CPU evaluations. In contrast, for benchmarks on the Apple Neural Engine (conducted on an iPhone 13 with iOS 16.6.1, CoreML- Tools 7.1, and Xcode 15.0.1 for profiling), PyTorch models were converted to CoreML’s MLProgram format in Float16 precision, with floatl6 MultiArray in- puts to minimize input copying.\n",

This combination demonstrates the flexibility of UIB and the importance of using different instantiation blocks in different stages of the network. Specifically, at the start of each searchable stage, where the spatial resolution significantly drops, ExtraDW emerges as the pre- ferred choice. The design of duo depthwise layers in ExtraDW helps to enlarge the receptive field, enhances spatial mixing, and effectively mitigates resolution loss. Similarly, ExtraDW is frequently selected in the early stages of MNv4- Conv models for similar reasons. For the final layers, where preceding layers have conducted substantial spatial mixing, FFN and ConvNext are chosen be- cause channel mixing provides a larger incremental gain.\n",

Counting MACs has high rank correlation for low-RP targets, but much lower rank correlation for high-RP targets. rs-Roofline is high for all targets under consideration. This shows the accuracy improvement from considering memory bandwidth in addition to MACs when estimating latency. All Ridge Point (RP) values fit in the 0-500 MACs/B range considered in our design analysis. These results are visualized in Fig. [6]\n",

We focus on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classifica- tion on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a hu- man error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable fea- tures of ImageNet classes.\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANS) are a class of methods for learning generative models based on game theory. The goal of GANs is to train a generator network G(z; 0°) that produces samples from the data distribution, paata(a), by transforming vectors of noise z as a = G(z; 0°). The training signal for G is provided by a discriminator network D(a) that is trained to distinguish samples from the generator distribution pmodei(a) from real data. The generator network G in turn is then trained to fool the discriminator into accepting its outputs as being real.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "Recent applications of GANs have shown that they can produce excellent samples [2] [3]. However, training GANs requires finding a Nash equilibrium of a non-convex game with continuous, high- dimensional parameters. GANs are typically trained using gradient descent techniques that are designed to find a low value of a cost function, rather than to find the Nash equilibrium of a game. When used to seek for a Nash equilibrium, these algorithms may fail to converge [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we introduce several techniques intended to encourage convergence of the GANs game. These techniques are motivated by a heuristic understanding of the non-convergence problem. They lead to improved semi-supervised learning peformance and improved sample generation. We hope that some of them may form the basis for future work, providing formal guarantees of convergence.\n",

A Nash equilibirum is a point (0), a) such that J“) is ata minimum with respect to 0) and J‘©) is at a minimum with respect to 0(@). Unfortunately, find- ing Nash equilibria is a very difficult problem. Algorithms exist for specialized cases, but we are not aware of any that are feasible to apply to the GAN game, where the cost functions are non-convex, the parameters are continuous, and the parameter space is extremely high-dimensional.\n",

For example, when one player minimizes xy with respect to x and another player minimizes —xy with respect to y, gradient descent enters a stable orbit, rather than converging to x = y = 0, the desired equilibrium point | Previous approaches to GAN training have thus applied gradient descent on each player’s cost simultaneously, despite the lack of guarantee that this procedure will converge.

      "3.1 Feature matching\n",
      "\n",
      "Feature matching addresses the instability of GANs by specifying a new objective for the generator that prevents it from overtraining on the current discriminator. Instead of directly maximizing the output of the discriminator, the new objective requires the generator to generate data that matches the statistics of the real data, where we use the discriminator only to specify the statistics that we think are worth matching. Specifically, we train the generator to match the expected value of the features on an intermediate layer of the discriminator. This is a natural choice of statistics for the generator to match, since by training the discriminator we ask it to find those features that are most discriminative of real data versus data generated by the current model.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "Letting f(a) denote activations on an intermediate layer of the discriminator, our new objective for the generator is defined as: ||Ee~p,,,f(@) — Ezxp,(z)f(G(z))||3. The discriminator, and hence f(a), are trained in the usual way. As with regular GAN training, the objective has a fixed point where G exactly matches the distribution of training data. We have no guarantee of reaching this fixed point in practice, but our empirical results indicate that feature matching is indeed effective in situations where regular GAN becomes unstable.\n",

      "3.2. Minibatch discrimination\n",
      "=========\n",
      "One of the main failure modes for GAN is for the generator to collapse to a parameter setting where it always emits the same point. When collapse to a single mode is imminent, the gradient of the discriminator may point in similar directions for many similar points. Because the discriminator processes each example independently, there is no coordination between its gradients, and thus no mechanism to tell the outputs of the generator to become more dissimilar to each other. Instead, all outputs race toward a single point that the discriminator currently believes is highly realistic. After collapse has occurred, the discriminator learns that this single point comes from the generator, but gradient descent is unable to separate the identical outputs. The gradients of the discriminator then push the single point produced by the generator around space forever, and the algorithm cannot converge to a distribution with the correct amount of entropy. An obvious strategy to avoid this type of\n",

      "=========\n",
      "The concept of minibatch discrimination is quite general: any discriminator model that looks at multiple examples in combination, rather than in isolation, could potentially help avoid col- lapse of the generator. In fact, the successful application of batch normalization in the dis- criminator by Radford et al. is well explained from this perspective. So far, however, we have restricted our experiments to models that explicitly aim to identify generator samples that are particularly close together. One successful specification for modelling the closeness between examples in a minibatch is as follows: Let f(a;) € R4 denote a vector of features for in- put x;, produced by some intermediate layer in the discriminator. We then multiply the vector f(a;) by a tensor T € R4*8*°, which results in a matrix M; € R?*°.

As before, the discriminator is still required to output a single number for each example indicating how likely it is to come from the training data: The task of the discriminator is thus effectively still to classify single examples as real data or generated data, but it is now able to use the other examples in the minibatch as side information. Minibatch discrimination allows us to generate visually appealing samples very quickly, and in this regard it is superior to feature matching (Section|6}. Interestingly, however, feature matching was found to work much better if the goal is to obtain a strong classifier using the approach to semi-supervised learning described in Section|5]\n",

In practice, Dunsupervisea Will only help if it is not trivial to minimize for our classifier and we thus need to train G' to approximate the data distribution. One way to do this is by training G to minimize the GAN game-value, using the discriminator D defined by our classifier. This approach introduces an interaction between G and our classifier that we do not fully understand yet, but empirically we find that optimizing G using feature matching GAN works very well for semi-supervised learning, while training G' using GAN with minibatch discrimination does not work at all.\n",

      "Generative adversarial networks are a promising class of generative models that has so far been held back by unstable training and by the lack of a proper evaluation metric. This work presents partial solutions to both of these problems. We propose several techniques to stabilize training that allow us to train models that were previously untrainable. Moreover, our proposed evaluation metric (the Inception score) gives us a basis for comparing the quality of these models. We apply our techniques to the problem of semi-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on a number of different data sets in computer vision. The contributions made in this work are of a practical nature; we hope to develop a more rigorous theoretical understanding in future work.\n",

In this paper, we sys- tematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and res- olution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.\n",

Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

The most common way is to scale up Con- vNets by their depth (He et al., 2016) or width (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Another less common, but increasingly popular, method is to scale up models by image resolution (Huang et al., 2018). In previous work, it is common to scale only one of the three dimensions — depth, width, and image size. Though it is possible to scale two or three dimensions arbitrarily, arbitrary scaling requires tedious manual tuning and still often yields sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency.\n",

      "In this paper, we want to study and rethink the process of scaling up ConvNets. In particular, we investigate the central question: is there a principled method to scale up ConvNets that can achieve better accuracy and efficiency? Our empirical study shows that it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width/depth/resolution, and surpris- ingly such balance can be achieved by simply scaling each of them with constant ratio. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective compound scaling method. Unlike conventional practice that arbitrary scales these fac- tors, our method uniformly scales network width, depth,\n",

      "ConvNet Accuracy: Since AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) won the 2012 ImageNet competition, ConvNets have become increasingly more accurate by going bigger: while the 2014 ImageNet winner GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) achieves 74.8% top-1 accuracy with about 6.8M parameters, the 2017 ImageNet winner SENet (Hu et al., 2018) achieves 82.7% top-1 accuracy with 145M parameters. Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) further pushes the state-of-the-art ImageNet top-1 validation accuracy to 84.3% using 557M parameters: it is so big that it can only be trained with a specialized pipeline parallelism library by partitioning the network and spreading each part to a different accelera- tor.

A ConvNet WN can be represented by a list of composed lay- ers: N= Fi, ©...O Fo OFi(X1) = Ojar..p Fi(X1). In practice, ConvNet layers are often partitioned into multiple stages and all layers in each stage share the same architec- ture: for example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) has five stages, and all layers in each stage has the same convolutional type except the first layer performs down-sampling.

However, deeper networks are also more difficult to train due to the vanishing gradient problem (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Although sev- eral techniques, such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), alleviate the training problem, the accuracy gain of very deep network diminishes: for example, ResNet-1000 has similar accuracy as ResNet-101 even though it has much more layers.

      "In this paper, we systematically study ConvNet scaling and identify that carefully balancing network width, depth, and resolution is an important but missing piece, preventing us from better accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a simple and highly effective compound scaling method, which enables us to easily scale up a baseline Con- vNet to any target resource constraints in a more principled way, while maintaining model efficiency. Powered by this compound scaling method, we demonstrate that a mobile- size EfficientNet model can be scaled up very effectively, surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy with an order of magni- tude fewer parameters and FLOPS, on both ImageNet and five commonly used transfer learning datasets.\n",

      "We present the next generation of MobileNets based on a combination of complementary search techniques as well as a novel architecture design. MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware- aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and net- work design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for re- lease: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of ob- ject detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We\n",

      "Designing deep neural network architecture for the op- timal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency has been an active research area in recent years. Both novel hand- crafted structures and algorithmic neural architecture search have played important roles in advancing this field.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "SqueezeNet[22] extensively uses 1x1 convolutions with squeeze and expand modules primarily focusing on re- ducing the number of parameters. More recent works shifts the focus from reducing parameters to reducing the number of operations (MAdds) and the actual mea- sured latency. MobileNetV1[19] employs depthwise sepa- rable convolution to substantially improve computation ef- ficiency. MobileNetV2[39] expands on this by introducing a resource-efficient block with inverted residuals and lin- ear bottlenecks. ShuffleNet[49] utilizes group convolution and channel shuffle operations to further reduce the MAdds. CondenseNet[21] learns group convolutions at the training stage to keep useful dense connections between layers for feature re-use. ShiftNet[46] proposes the shift operation in- terleaved with point-wise convolutions to replace expensive spatial convolutions.\n",

So early works of architecture search focus on the cell level structure search, and the same cell is reused in all layers.

      "\n",
      "Mobile models have been built on increasingly more effi- cient building blocks. MobileNetV1 [19] introduced depth- wise separable convolutions as an efficient replacement for traditional convolution layers. Depthwise separable convo- lutions effectively factorize traditional convolution by sep- arating spatial filtering from the feature generation mech- anism. Depthwise separable convolutions are defined by two separate layers: light weight depthwise convolution for spatial filtering and heavier 1x1 pointwise convolutions for feature generation.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "MobileNetV2 [39] introduced the linear bottleneck and inverted residual structure in order to make even more effi- cient layer structures by leveraging the low rank nature of the problem. This structure is shown on Figure 3 and is defined by a 1x1 expansion convolution followed by depth- wise convolutions and a 1x1 projection layer. The input and output are connected with a residual connection if and only if they have the same number of channels. This structure maintains a compact representation at the input and the out- put while expanding to a higher-dimensional feature space internally to increase the expressiveness of nonlinear per- channel transformations.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "MnasNet [43] built upon the MobileNetV2 structure by introducing lightweight attention modules based on squeeze and excitation into the bottleneck structure. Note that the squeeze and excitation module are integrated in a different location than ResNet based modules proposed in [20]. The module is placed after the depthwise filters in the expansion in order for attention to be applied on the largest represen- tation as shown on Figure 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "For MobileNetV3, we use a combination of these layers as building blocks in order to build the most effective mod- els. Layers are also upgraded with modified swish nonlin- earities [36, 13, 16]. Both squeeze and excitation as well as the swish nonlinearity use the sigmoid which can be ineffi- cient to compute as well challenging to maintain accuracy in fixed point arithmetic so we replace this with the hard sigmoid [2, | 1] as discussed in section 5.2.\n",

For MobileNetV3 we use platform-aware NAS to search for the global network structures by optimiz- ing each network block. We then use the NetAdapt algo- rithm to search per layer for the number of filters. These techniques are complementary and can be combined to ef- fectively find optimized models for a given hardware plat- form.\n",

We propose some modifications to the architecture to reduce the latency of these slow layers while maintaining the accuracy. These modifications are outside of the scope of the current search space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first modification reworks how the last few lay- ers of the network interact in order to produce the final features more efficiently. Current models based on Mo- bileNetV2’s inverted bottleneck structure and variants use 1x1 convolution as a final layer in order to expand to a higher-dimensional feature space. This layer is critically important in order to have rich features for prediction. How- ever, this comes at a cost of extra latency.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "To reduce latency and preserve the high dimensional fea- tures, we move this layer past the final average pooling. This final set of features is now computed at 1x1 spatial resolution instead of 7x7 spatial resolution. The outcome of this design choice is that the computation of the features becomes nearly free in terms of computation and latency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the cost of this feature generation layer has been mitigated, the previous bottleneck projection layer is no longer needed to reduce computation. This observation al- lows us to remove the projection and filtering layers in the previous bottleneck layer, further reducing computational complexity.

In our experiments, we found hard-version of all these functions to have no discernible difference in accuracy, but multi- ple advantages from a deployment perspective. First, opti- mized implementations of ReLU6 are available on virtually all software and hardware frameworks.

      "In this subsection, we employ MobileNetV2 [39] and the proposed MobileNetV3 as network backbones for the task of mobile semantic segmentation. Additionally, we com- pare two segmentation heads. The first one, referred to as R-ASPP, was proposed in [39]. R-ASPP is a reduced de- sign of the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module [7, 8, 9], which adopts only two branches consisting of a 1 x 1 con- volution and a global-average pooling operation [29, 50]. In this work, we propose another light-weight segmenta- tion head, referred to as Lite R-ASPP (or LR-ASPP), as shown in Fig. 10. Lite R-ASPP, improving over R-ASPP, deploys the global-average pooling in a fashion similar to the Squeeze-and-Excitation module [20], in which we em- ploy a large pooling kernel with a large stride (to save some computation) and only one 1 x 1 convolution in the module. We apply atrous convolution [18, 40, 33, 6] to the last block of MobileNetV3 to extract denser features, and further add a skip connection [30]\n",

      "We conduct the experiments on the Cityscapes dataset [10] with metric mIOU [14], and only exploit the ‘fine’ an- notations. We employ the same training protocol as [8, 39]. All our models are trained from scratch without pretraining on ImageNet [38], and are evaluated with a single-scale in- put. Similar to object detection, we observe that we could reduce the channels in the last block of network backbone by a factor of 2 without degrading the performance signif- icantly. We think it is because the backbone is designed for 1000 classes ImageNet image classification [38] while there are only 19 classes on Cityscapes, implying there is some channel redundancy in the backbone.\n",

      "We report our Cityscapes validation set results in Tab. 7. As shown in the table, we observe that (1) reducing the channels in the last block of network backbone by a fac- tor of 2 significantly improves the speed while maintaining similar performances (row | vs. row 2, and row 5 vs. row 6), (2) the proposed segmentation head LR-ASPP is slightly faster than R-ASPP [39] while performance is improved (row 2 vs. row 3, and row 6 vs. row 7), (3) reducing the filters in the segmentation head from 256 to 128 improves the speed at the cost of slightly worse performance (row 3 vs. row 4, and row 7 vs. row 8), (4) when employing the same setting, MobileNetV3 model variants attain similar performance while being slightly faster than MobileNetV2 counterparts (row | vs. row 5, row 2 vs. row 6, row 3 vs. row 7, and row 4 vs. row 8), (5) MobileNetV3-Small attains similar performance as MobileNetV2-0.5 while be- ing faster, and (6) MobileNetV3-Small is significantly bet- ter than MobileNetV2-0.35\n",

The performance drops slightly by 0.6% when not employing the atrous convolution to extract dense feature maps in the last block of MobileNetV3, but the speed is improved to 1.98B (for half-resolution inputs), which is 1.36, 1.59, and 2.27 times faster than ESPNetv2, CCC2, and ESPNetv 1, respectively.

      "In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsuper- vised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANSs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolu- tional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image repre- sentations.\n",

      "Learning reusable feature representations from large unlabeled datasets has been an area of active research. In the context of computer vision, one can leverage the practically unlimited amount of unlabeled images and videos to learn good intermediate representations, which can then be used on a variety of supervised learning tasks such as image classification. We propose that one way to build good image representations is by training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) jet al.}/2014), and later reusing parts of the generator and discriminator networks as feature extractors for supervised tasks. GANs provide an attractive alternative to maximum likelihood techniques. One can additionally argue that their learning process and the lack of a heuristic cost function (such as pixel-wise independent mean-square error) are attractive to representation learning. GANs have been known to be unstable to train, often resulting in generators that produce nonsensical outputs. There has been very\n",

The strongest example of this is global average pooling which has been utilized in state of the art image classification models (Mordvintsev et al.). We found global average pooling increased model stability but hurt convergence speed. A middle ground of directly connecting the highest convolutional features to the input and output respectively of the generator and discriminator worked well. The first layer of the GAN, which takes a uniform noise distribution Z as input, could be called fully connected as it is just a matrix multiplication, but the result is reshaped into a 4-dimensional tensor and used as the start of the convolution stack. For the discriminator, the last convolution layer is flattened and then fed into a single sigmoid output. See Fig [I] for a visualization of an example model architecture.\n",

      "Third is Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy| which stabilizes learning by normalizing the input to each unit to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps deal with training problems that arise due to poor initialization and helps gradient flow in deeper models. This proved critical to get deep generators to begin learning, preventing the generator from collapsing all samples to a single point which is a common failure mode observed in GANs. Directly applying batchnorm to all layers however, resulted in sample oscillation and model instability. This was avoided by not applying batchnorm to the generator output layer and the discriminator input layer.\n",

We investigated whether similar structure emerges in the Z representation of our generators. We performed similar arithmetic on the Z vectors of sets of exemplar samples for visual concepts. Experiments working on only single samples per concept were unstable, but averaging the Z vector for three examplars showed consistent and stable generations that semantically obeyed the arithmetic.

We found that removing the scale and bias parameters from batchnorm produced better results for both models. We speculate that the noise introduced by batchnorm helps the generative models to better explore and generate from the underlying data distribution. The results are shown in Table 3] which compares our models with other techniques.

We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, this loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANSs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline—R3GAN (“Re-GAN”).

      "Generative adversarial networks (GANS) let us generate high-quality images in a single forward pass. However, the original objective in Goodfellow et al. [13], is notoriously difficult to optimize due to its minimax nature. This leads to a fear that training might diverge at any point due to instability, and a fear that generated images might lose diversity through mode collapse. While there has been progress in GAN objectives [14, 22, 81, 52, 64], practically, the effects of brittle losses are still regularly felt. This notoriety has had a lasting negative impact on GAN research.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "A complementary issue—partly motivated by this instability—is that existing popular GAN backbones like StyleGAN [29, 31, 30, 32] use many poorly-understood empirical tricks with little theory. For instance, StyleGAN uses a gradient penalized non-saturating loss [52] to increase stability (affecting sample diversity), but then employs a minibatch standard deviation trick [28] to increase sample diversity. Without tricks, the StyleGAN backbone still resembles DCGAN [60] from 2015, yet it is still the common backbone of SOTA GANs such as GigaGAN [26] and StyleGAN-T [70]. Advances in GANs have been conservative compared to other generative models such as diffusion models [20, 78, 33, 34], where modern computer vision techniques such as multi-headed self attention [87] and backbones such as preactivated ResNet [17], U-Net [63] and vision transformers (ViTs) [9] are the norm. Given outdated backbones, it is not surprising that there is a widely-spread belief that GANs do not scale in terms\n",

First, we propose a novel objective that augments the relativistic pairing GAN loss (RpGAN; [22]) with zero-centered gradient penalties [52, 64], improving stability [14, 64, 52]. We show mathematically that gradient-penalized RpGAN enjoys the same guarantee of local convergence as regularized classic GANs, and that removing our regularization scheme induces non-convergence.\n",

      "Once we have a well-behaved loss, none of the GAN tricks are necessary [28, 31], and we are free to engineer a modern SOTA backbone architecture. We strip StyleGAN of all its features, identify those that are essential, then borrow new architecture designs from modern ConvNets and transformers [48, 97]. Briefly, we find that proper ResNet design [17, 67], initialization [99], and resampling [29, 31, 32, 100] are important, along with grouped convolution [95, 5] and no normalization [31, 34, 14, 88, 4].

However, in practical implementations, the empirical GAN loss typically shifts fake samples beyond the decision boundary set by D, as opposed to directly updating the density function pg.

Sun et al. [8 1] characterize such degenerate solutions as bad local minima in the landscape of £, and show that Eq. | has exponentially many bad local minima. The culprit is the existence of a single decision boundary that naturally arises when real and fake data are considered in isolation. RpGAN introduces a simple solution by coupling real and fake data, i.e. a fake sample is critiqued by its realness relative to a real sample, which effectively maintains a decision boundary in the neighborhood of each real sample and hence forbids\n",

Analysis on the training dynamics of GANs has thus far focused on local convergence [55, 51, 52], i.e., whether the training at least converges when (6, 7) are in a neighborhood of (6*, 7)*). In such a scenario, the convergence behavior can be analyzed [55, 51, 52] by examining the spectrum of the Jacobian of the gradient vector field (—VoL, VL) at (0*, ~*). The key insight here is that when G already produces the true distribution, we want V,,D = 0, so that G is not pushed away from its optimal state, and thus the training does not oscillate. R; and Rz impose such a constraint when pg = pp. This also explains why earlier attempts at gradient penalties, such as the one-centered gradient penalty (1-GP) in WGAN-GP [14], fail to achieve convergent training [52] as they still encourage D to have a non-zero slope when G has reached optimality.\n",

Next, while theoretically sufficient for local convergence, RBGAN with only R; regularization is also unstable and diverges quickly’. In each case, the gradient of D on fake samples explodes when training diverges. With both R; and Ro, training becomes stable for both the classic GAN and RpGAN. Now stable, we can see that the classic GAN suffers from mode dropping, whereas RpGAN achieves full mode coverage (Tab. |) and reduces Dx, from 0.9270 to 0.0781. As a point of contrast, StyleGAN [29, 31, 30, 32] uses the minibatch standard deviation trick to reduce mode dropping, improving mode coverage from 857 to 881 on StackedMNIST? and with barely any improvement on Dx [28].\n",

In this scenario, if D is sufficiently powerful, regularizing D solely on real data is not likely to have much effect on D’s behavior on fake data and so training can fail due to an ill-behaved D on fake data.

We set the group size to 16 rather than | (i.e. depthwise convolution as in ConvNeXt) as depthwise convolution is highly inefficient on GPUs and is not much faster than using a larger group size. With grouped convolution, we can reduce the bottleneck compression ratio to two given the same model size. This increases the width of the bottleneck to 1.5 as wide as Config A.

We also omitted common techniques that have been shown in previous literature to improve FID considerably.

Central to our approach is a regularized relativistic loss that provably features local convergence and that improves the stability of GAN training. This stable loss enables us to ablate various tricks that were previously necessary in GANs, and incorporate in their place modern deep architectures. The resulting streamlined baseline achieves competitive performance to SOTA models within its parameter size class. We anticipate that our backbone will help to drive future GAN research.\n",

      "We tried adding group normalization [92] to G and D and it did not improve FID or training stability. We do not claim that all forms of normalizations are harmful. Our claim in principle c) only extends to normalization layers that explicitly standardizes the mean and standard deviation of the activation maps. This has been verified by prior studies [31, 34, 65]. The harm of normalization layers extends to the adjacent field of image restoration [43, 88]. To the best of our knowledge, EDM2 [34] is currently the strongest diffusion UNet and it does not use normalization layers. However, it does apply normalization to the trainable weights and this improves performance considerably. We expect that applying the normalization techniques in EDM2 would improve our model’s performance.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "We tried removing the activation function after the 3x3 grouped convolution in each residual block as modern architectures [48, 97] typically do not apply non-linearity after depthwise convolution. This worsened FID performance.\n",

      "We tried Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle [71] for changing the resolution of the activation maps, and found that without low-pass filtering, this led to high frequency artifacts similar to checkerboard artifacts even though Pixel-Shuffle does not have the uneven overlap problem that transposed convolution does. Note that bilinear resampling is equivalent to applying channel duplication/averaging with Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle in conjunction with a [1, 2, 1] low-pass kernel. It might be interesting in future studies to explore inplace resampling filters that apply a low-pass filtered Pixel-Shuffle/Unshuffle operation on top of a learned function that changes the number of channels.\n",
      "=========\n",
      "We tried scaling up our model size. We found that allocating more model capacity to lower resolution stages generally did not improve FID, but contributed to more rapid overfitting. Increasing model capacity at higher resolution stages always improves FID in our experiments, however scaling up higher resolution stages is very computationally expensive. Capacity distribution for each resolution stage of the model might be an important topic to explore in future studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For model simplicity, we did not conduct any experiment with a transformer architecture or attention mechanism in general. We are interested to see whether adding attention blocks to a convolutional network (similar to BigGAN [3] and diffusion UNet [20, 33, 34]) or using a pure transformer architecture (similar to DiT [58]) will result in stronger performance. Given the impressive results of EDM2 [34] (which uses UNet), it seems the argument has not yet settled for generative modeling.\n",

It was introduced in 2016 by Radford et al. in the paper *\"Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.\"*  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **What Makes DCGAN Special?**  \n",
      "DCGAN's architecture introduced several key improvements over earlier GANs, making training more stable and enabling higher-quality image generation. Here are its defining features:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Replaces Fully Connected Layers with Convolutions**  \n",
      "   - Earlier GANs relied on dense (fully connected) layers, which limited scalability.  \n",
      "   - DCGAN uses **transposed convolutions (fractionally strided convolutions)** in the generator to upsample images progressively.  \n",
      "   - The discriminator uses **strided convolutions** instead of pooling for downsampling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Batch Normalization**  \n",
      "   - Applies batch normalization in both the generator and discriminator to stabilize training by reducing internal covariate shift.  \n",
      "   - Helps prevent mode collapse and improves gradient flow.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **LeakyReLU in Discriminator, ReLU in Generator**  \n",
      "   - The discriminator uses **LeakyReLU** (leaky rectified linear unit) to avoid sparse gradients.  \n",
      "   - The generator uses standard **ReLU**, except for the output layer, which uses **tanh** to constrain pixel values to [-1, 1].  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No Max Pooling**  \n",
      "   - Instead of max pooling, DCGAN relies on **strided convolutions** for downsampling, allowing the network to learn its own spatial downsampling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use of Adam Optimizer**  \n",
      "   - DCGAN uses the **Adam optimizer** with tuned hyperparameters (e.g., low momentum) to prevent oscillations during training.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Impact of DCGAN**  \n",
      "- Demonstrated that GANs could generate **high-resolution, coherent images** (e.g., faces, bedrooms).  \n",
      "- Established architectural best practices that influenced later GAN variants (e.g., ProGAN, StyleGAN).  \n",
      "- Showed that the generator learns meaningful latent representations, enabling vector arithmetic in latent space (e.g., \"smiling woman\" - \"neutral woman\" + \"neutral man\" = \"smiling man\").  \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Expansion Phase**: The block first expands the input tensor's channel dimension using a 1x1 convolution (pointwise convolution), increasing its depth (e.g., by a factor of 6). This helps capture richer features.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Depthwise Convolution**: A lightweight 3x3 depthwise convolution is applied to the expanded tensor, processing spatial information while keeping computational costs low.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Linear Bottleneck**: Instead of applying a non-linearity (like ReLU6) to the output, the block uses a linear activation (no non-linearity) in the final 1x1 convolution. This prevents information loss in low-dimensional spaces, as ReLU can destroy useful features when applied to compressed representations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Residual Connection**: The block includes a skip connection (residual) between the input and output, but only if the input and output dimensions match.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Why It’s \"Inverted\":  \n",
      "- Traditional residual blocks (e.g., in ResNet) *reduce* channels in the bottleneck and *expand* later.  \n",
      "- MobileNetV2 *expands* first (wide bottleneck) and *compresses* back, hence \"inverted.\"  \n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Components:  \n",
      "1. **Squeeze Operation**:  \n",
      "   - Uses **global average pooling** (GAP) to aggregate spatial information (e.g., \\( H \\times W \\)) into a channel descriptor (a vector of size \\( C \\)). This captures global context per channel.  \n",
      "   - Experiments (e.g., in the cited work) show GAP slightly outperforms global max pooling, though the SE block is robust to the choice of aggregation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Excitation Operation**:  \n",
      "   - A small neural network (typically two FC layers with a bottleneck) processes the squeezed vector to produce channel-wise attention weights.  \n",
      "   - A **sigmoid** activation scales these weights to \\([0, 1]\\), emphasizing informative channels and suppressing less useful ones.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Connection to Attention:  \n",
      "- The SE block acts as a *self-attention* mechanism for channels, akin to soft feature selection. It learns to \"attend\" to important channels adaptively, similar to how spatial attention focuses on salient regions.  \n",
      "- Unlike spatial attention (e.g., in non-local networks), SE operates along the channel dimension, making it computationally lightweight.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Empirical Support:  \n",
      "- The cited works (e.g., by Hu et al.) demonstrate SE blocks improve performance in CNNs like ResNet and MobileNet by modeling channel relationships.  \n",
      "- The robustness to pooling choices (Sec. 6.2 in the context) suggests the excitation step (non-linear gating) is more critical than the squeeze method.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, SE blocks introduce channel-wise attention to CNNs, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead.
